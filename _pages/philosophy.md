## How I define leadership

My leadership philosophy today revolves around service. 
While I am at the helm of leadership, I always remind myself to be humble, and to remember that I am in leadership in service of other people in my community. 
As a person with several marginalized identities, supporting these communities and being strong for the people is incredibly important for my mission in helping bring organization to these groups. 
And, while I work hard at leadership (it doesn’t come easy to me!) I remember that taking care of myself is another pillar - it reminds myself and others that people like me exist, and can flourish, even in difficult times. 

## My leadership evolution

Leadership didn’t always come easy to me. Like many other people, I grew up incredibly shy, and even intentionally barred myself from leadership positions I wanted, because I didn’t think I could do it. But I grew up, and after seeing the state of the world during the COVID-19 pandemic, I knew that someone had to step up. Thinking back to my values, I faced my fears and put myself in positions of service so that I could support my communities, who in turn would support myself.
