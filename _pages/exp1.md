## Overview
This was my internship over the summer of 2023, where I worked as an IT Security Intern for the Governance, Risk, and Compliance team at MultiCare, a local hospital system in Tacoma. As part of the Governance, Risk, and Compliance team, my duties were mostly around ensuring legal compliance with IT security standards and other laws, like HIPAA, as well as documenting technology risk and mitigations. I also had a brief time when I was working with the Identity and Access Management team on reorganizing the hospital’s thousands of users and making sure that there were no duplicate accounts and groups. Overall, though it was remote, I had a lot of fun and grew a lot in my first corporate role. 

## Personal Importance of Work
This work was really important to me as one of my most important experiences. I gained a valuable overview of the IT Security field, and some knowledge of basic concepts that I later used to obtain my own basic cybersecurity certification. I gave back to the organization by ensuring compliance with laws and regulations, which helped the security posture of the company. More personally, being able to do the work in the internship and having people respect and believe in me was empowering. All in all, this experience made me realize that I enjoyed working in IT Security, and led me to pursue more related positions and classes. 

## Tasks Accomplished
- Ensured compliance with security policies by maintaining policies on NIST 800-53, HIPAA, and PCI standards, completing a critical part of the requirements for Safe Harbor law
- Maintained up-to-date documentation on third-party system configurations for risk assessments and mitigation, as well as IT processes for future reference.
- Applied user access controls in an Identity and Account Management (IAM) platform to enforce least privilege for user accounts and permissions
- Collaborated and communicated with the GRC and IAM teams and other interns, as well as technical security and software development teams to improve overall infrastructure resilience


## Leadership Competencies Gained

### Analysis
One role I had was learning and doing a little bit of risk analysis for third-party systems. We gathered a lot of information about vendor systems, such as how their network was set up, whether they used a cloud, how often they required users to change passwords, etc., and we had to turn all of this information into a risk assessment to ensure compliance with security standards. This meant doing some analysis on the information. While most of the information was automated through a risk management portal, by looking at the process, I gained insight into how to examine information and turn it into a few key insights. This was important because the insights were eventually presented to other security staff members, who were either in charge of mitigation or otherwise dealing with risks.


### Organizational behavior
This was my first time in a large organization, which meant that I had to learn a lot about working in a team. The most difficult part was in the beginning, where I had to quickly establish myself as actively part of the team, while figuring out all of the team building technologies we used. By asking around and researching online, I was able to determine the structure of the IT teams and different departments, which gave me a better understanding of how my role as a GRC team member fit into the organization. This gave me a better understanding of how my role impacted others and how it protected the organization’s information.


### Writing
While I was already proficient in writing essays, this role required me to write in a totally different manner; as part of updating security compliance, I helped draft policies for the organization. I read through existing policies that the organization had, as well as the standards and regulations I was translating from into policies. By observing parts that went well for the policies, I was able to replicate that in my own policies. I also had to optimize for clear and concise communication so that policies were understandable to both organization employees and auditors. By the end, the policies I wrote were approved by my manager.


### Initiative
By the mid-point of the internship, I had run out of things to do, since I worked quickly through my tasks. Though it was initially difficult, I started taking initiative for my own time, asking for projects I could do to help out at the organization. I ended up completing another IAM task as well as another GRC task for user education. I continued to carry this initiative after the internship ended, using the knowledge gained from the job to study and pass a certification exam for cybersecurity. By proving that I have the drive to take projects on my own with clear results, I show that I am a motivated, task-oriented person. 


## Lessons Learned
Like I said above, I gained some practical knowledge of IT security operations and administration, a few technical skills, and a lot of motivation for the future. I used the practical knowledge gained to pursue an IT Security certification with ISC2, and I continue to use some of my experiences as lessons in my current role as a Teaching Assistant for Computer Security. In an effort to understand the more technical aspects of IT, I seek and plan to seek out more non-programming IT courses and roles, such as System Administration. I plan to use my leadership competencies mostly in other roles that require heavy documentation and team playing, as well as the initiative to keep learning about this field.
