My Core Values are as follows: 

## 1. Discipline 
The most important value, Discipline, guides how I approach all processes. There is a “respect for the craft”, in the sense that the process is as important as the destination. Each step has a purpose, and only mastering each step can allow one to manipulate the process. For example, in acquiring knowledge, I consciously engage with original materials and dialogues, coming to conclusions through experimentation, versus taking the shortcut to the end. 

## 2. Reliability
Have reliable missions - have clear, communicable goals, and stick to them. In my study as a Computer Scientist, part of the “philosophy of computer science” is the “specification” - this states what will be accomplished and to what extent, so that one piece can fit reliably in a whole. People depend on you, and this relies on some consistency.

## 3. Flexibility
Yet have flexible methods - be able to change implementations, sticking to the best technology for a given problem. While goals should remain the same, it’s okay to change and experiment with different approaches.

## 4. Sensitivity
The sensitivity to deal with others in the world in the most gracious way. In order to maintain sensitivity, one must also be curious about the world and diversity; they must continue to engage with others and have the capability to maintain relationships.

## 5. Prosperity
Finally, remembering to have fun and be in good health, taking care of one’s own prosperity. It’s important to be a leader, but it is also important to take time for one’s own hobbies and comfort.
