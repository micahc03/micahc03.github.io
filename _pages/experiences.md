## Systems Educator

[LINK] (https://micahc03.github.io/ex2.html) Over the summer of 2024, instead of taking an internship experience, I decided to hone my
leadership skills elsewhere by becoming a Teaching Assistant for the summer section of Intro
to Operating Systems. This was my first major experience teaching after an initial bad
experience, and it taught me how to teach subjects effectively, coordinate with coworkers, and
reinforced my programming and systems skills. It meant a lot to me because I had always
thought I was bad at social interaction and leadership, but I ended up making a lot of friends
and getting over my fear of public speaking.
