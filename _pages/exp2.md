## Overview
Over the summer of 2024, instead of taking an internship experience, I decided to hone my leadership skills elsewhere by becoming a Teaching Assistant for the summer section of Intro to Operating Systems. This was my first major experience teaching after an initial bad experience, and it taught me how to teach subjects effectively, coordinate with coworkers, and reinforced my programming and systems skills. It meant a lot to me because I had always thought I was bad at social interaction and leadership, but I ended up making a lot of friends and getting over my fear of public speaking.

## Personal Importance of Work
This experience connects to my interest in systems programming, because I had to refresh my knowledge enough to be able to teach others. Systems programming, design, and other technology tools, like git, are important to me because I like working with technology, but I prefer to be on the design and system development side of things, rather than directly programming. This class reinforced my interest in system administration and security analyst roles, and tools I used will continue to help me in my career.
It also connects to my values of giving back to the community and keeping traditions and knowledge alive. The process and discipline of learning is something to be shared between students and educators, and this opportunity finally gave me the chance to be on both sides, which helped me feel fulfilled and capable in my knowledge as a CS major. 


## Tasks Accomplished
- Lectured in weekly lessons to 15-20 people a class, on topics ranging from C programming basics, memory management, and processes.
- Graded assignments for 60 students a week, according to an established rubric, giving constructive feedback to help students grow 
- Responded within an hour to student questions on the online course board, assisting in students’ knowledge on the topics
- Assisted in deploying course autograders and scripts, improving past scripts to make them more robust for future offerings of the course


## Leadership Competencies Gained

### Problem Solving
I had to use a lot of problem solving in this role. One of the biggest challenges was sitting with students in office hours and problem solving through their code side by side. This meant that I needed to develop a mental workflow for solving problems. The one that I used for programming problems, for example, was to first diagnose the issue - what was the student stuck on? The concept, or programming the concept out? - and then to address the issue. Lastly, I would debrief the student on what the problem was and how we solved it together. This also worked with myself and my own problem solving.


### Helping Others
Helping others was another major component of this role, as I was always helping students. This competency worked particularly well with the previous one, because I used my problem solving framework to help others. However, it is slightly different because I also wanted to help students develop methods to help themselves in the future.
For example, after a debugging session, I asked students what questions, methods, and tools they could use to solve similar problems in the future. If a student had a debugging problem, I would direct them to GDB and a checklist of things to look at in the code, such as the current stack frame and arguments. If a student had a conceptual problem, I would direct them to the lecture slides, and ask for them to explain what they think is happening, correcting them along the way. This sensitivity to different types of problems helped me help others effectively.


### Providing Feedback
I had to provide a lot of feedback as part of the grading process in this class. Feedback was important because it helped students understand and grow from past mistakes. Effective feedback was more difficult than simply saying “correct” or “incorrect.” One framework I used for providing feedback was to 1) state the problem and assumptions the student made, 2) explain the underlying concept, and finally 3) explain the solution, now that the concept was laid out. For example, many students had problems with tradeoffs between cache designs. For the people who had the incorrect idea, I re-explained the cache to them (maybe they missed the lecture?) and how that related to their idea specifically. 
Of course, I also gave back good feedback when students did well! This helped to affirm that they were understanding the material correctly.


### Verbal Communication
Another huge thing was verbal communication, especially since I was lecturing at the front of the class. Verbal communication does not come naturally to me, and I spent a while preparing for each class before I got there the next morning. Some things that helped were to first understand the concept, and work through my own questions about the material, and then try to anticipate questions. After that, I rehearsed the lessons so that I could budget time for questions. I also thought of alternative ways and visual aids, such as the whiteboards, of communicating what I was saying, such that students had something to look at while I explained topics to them. 


### Facilitation
A smaller component was facilitating discussions. This one was difficult because I had to gauge audience interest and adjust discussions accordingly - nothing ever goes as planned. However, it was worth it because discussions help people reinforce their understanding of the material. For example, before introducing a new concept, I would ask students if they had heard of it before, and if they had any personal experiences with it. If there were no hands being raised, I could ask a follow up question to make the facilitation easier, or share a personal anecdote to get the conversation going. This is definitely one of the harder competencies to master, but one of the most important.


### Positive Attitude
Since this was my first time teaching at the college level, I experienced a lot of setbacks. I actually had a previous experience teaching programming to kids in elementary school, but it didn’t go well, which put me off teaching and finding a job for a while - I was afraid of things I couldn’t control and getting bad reviews for them. But, knowing that I was in the company of friends, who were veteran TAs for the course, I did my best to put on a positive attitude towards coming into the classroom every day. I did things to help the fear - I practiced before section, I read and re-read the lab materials so that I knew what I was talking about, and I talked to people who affirmed that I was going to be okay. And though it is still hard for me to be 100% positive all the time, sometimes reminding myself that it would be okay was enough to push through the tough times. 


## Lessons Learned
The insights gained from this experience gave me the confidence to finally interact with other people in my program. Talking to my coworkers and my students was a form of networking that felt natural and unstrained, which helped me relax around people. I took major lessons in teaching and maintaining course infrastructure that I use today in my current TA role, where I hone the skills I gained in this experience. However, I know I will be able to use my skills in more than just other teaching roles - I can use my presentation skills that I gained in this experience in any professional role, and helping students in office hours gave me a knack for problem solving alongside others. Wherever I land, thinking about this experience will be sure to give me a sense of, “I can do it!”
