## My background

Nice to meet you! I'm Micah Chang, a senior and at the time of writing, an almost grad from the University of Washington's Paul G. Allen School for Computer Science & Engineering, with minors in Ethics and Public Policy. My major passions include computer and cyber security; I loved interning on an IT Security at a local hospital network, and I have been a Teaching Assistant for Intro to Operating Systems as well as Computer Security for almost a year now. I am also invested in promoting diversity and inclusion at the Allen School, serving as the chair for Q++, the queer social engagement club here. I believe that my skills, values, and experience will have a place on any team as a leader.
